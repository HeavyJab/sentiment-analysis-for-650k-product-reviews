Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me $10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

There was a gang fight in the lobby my first night there. The hallways reek of cheap perfume. My shower drain didn't work due to it being clogged with hair. My window looked out on the wall of the neighboring hotel. Life is too short to stay at The Quad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

My husband and I both ordered burgers (Guy's signature burger and the Mac n cheese burger) and they were both delicious. The fries were just amazing. Our drinks were good (jack n coke for the husband and some blackberry margarita for me), could have been stronger but still tasty.  The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service was kind of slow and it wasn't super busy.

       "Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!\r\n",

I have had such an awful experience with this particular location! So the first time I went for lens fitting, I was given EXPIRED lens that caused irritation in my eyes!! I went back and was given another trial by Dr. To however I noticed blurry eyes with this particular lens! I went today and discussed my concern with the owner Dr Chiu!! She is the most arrogant and ignorant person I ever met! She disregard my concern and instead of offering a solution to my concern which was blurry vision with this current lenses, she abandon me as the patient by simply refunding me the lens fitting cost!! What kind of ignorant doctor does that!!! She simply said I'm unhappy with their service and shud find another ophthalmologist! She disregard my concern and got rid of me instead!! She told me that I need to start from scratch!! Thanks for wasting my time then!

I would never expect a place so unassuming, to provide such an authentic and inspiring meal.  Located at the corner of Missouri and 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ The French Grocery offers fine French food at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  It features a small sitting area, that starts it's day as a lively cafe offering fine pastries and strong coffee, then thoughtfully ending it, serving a beautiful dinner every evening.\r\n",
       "     My first dinner visit I had the pleasure of enjoying the Trout Amandine.  It was a beautifully cooked piece of trout breaded in almond flour, served with asparagus and think sliced potatoes cooked in butter.  The flavors we're outrageous and I could barely hold myself back for another bite.  Everything about it screamed classic French, from the rich butter sauce that the trout was served in, to the moist of fish wrapped in a crunchy almond flour crust.  I was just blown away.\r\n",

The front office only seemed to care about whether or not my pain was from a car accident and how they could maximize their billing.   The treatment itself was also not effective and I never felt any change from their service.  Again, they mostly just wanted to maximize how much they could get from me and from the insurance carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!\r\n",

       "I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.\r\n",

Staff is friendly and we got seated immediately. Ordered the home made ice cream and it was delicious. The batter of the waffle was excellent and not over cooked or hard like some places. Only thing I found was a bit lacking is the amount of fruit they give you on your waffle order which costs like $8+ ... it was a bit lacking felt like all I ate was ice cream and pretty much the waffle for the price. Just a tip, ensure u at least be a bit more generous on your fruit portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

I eat out alot and have traveled around the world eating Italian  food,  excluding Italy. This wasn't the worst meal I had but it was pretty close. The waiter was very friendly and it seemed very talkative,  too talkative. He also tended to hover alot at the the table, maybe because the place was verually empty on a Friday night. This should have been the sign that the food wasn't very good! He mentioned that the chef was trained in Europe of Michelin star resturant and that the pasta was made on sight and that all the ingredients where freshly sourced from local producers daily. Maybe he worked at the Michelin tires store in Europe not a resturant! These other people that gave this place a five star rating either don't eat out much or diffentaly had something else, not the pasta I had. The waiter said that the poritions weren't  small like most fancy resturants but a good size, they were small!!!!!

My wife had King Key rekey one door and install a new deadbolt. Should have been about $100. We were charged $540!! I had to have another company come out and fix the deadbolt because it was installed incorrectly by King Key.This is outrageous!

I really want this place to do well, however, as I think they have a lot of potential with a mostly untapped market in The Annex.  Hopefully consistently improves as they go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td></tr>\n",

It's not flashy and it won't wow you, but it will leave you satisfied.  We were shopping at Square 1 and were looking for a Chinese restaurant near by.  Having a Chatime in the same plaza also helps!\r\n",

The first full set I received here was great and lasted about 10 days.  After that, each fill was only lasting 5-7 days.  I then upgraded to their unlimited membership as I was having to go so often.  I am attaching a picture of my eyelashes 4 days after a fill.  I have been having my lashes done for two years and I have never experienced such poor retention in fills.  Furthermore, I called their number to cancel an appointment as I was fed up.  I was now just emailed that they charged me 50% of an appointment for not cancelling.

There were 3 people in our party and 2 were served our meals with the last person in the party never getting his meal. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come back and let us know something about our 3rd persons meal. When he didn't appear, we approached the bar ourselves. He assured us the meal had been ordered and would be out soon. The meal finally shows up, as the rest of the parties empty dishes were being cleared. When requesting other items that should've came with the meal, we waited another 15 minutes. Check out process was another 20 mins.. Probably won't be back. Sad because I had high hopes for this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

We should have known .. but we tried it anyway as we left because of no service and walked over to Harolds which had a 40 minute wait for 2, and then went back.  The service at the bar was horrible (we sat there FOREVER before one of the cranky bartenders asked what we needed), the food was God awful (Had the French Dip -- was the worst I've ever had)and the drinks were SUPER weak and expensive.  Then we waited FOREVER for our food and again, the place was EMPTY.   Not to mention the stupid menu's they have.  I would think it shouldn't be open for business much longer.  Oh, maybe the bartenders would cheer up if they didn't have to lug their own cases of beer up from the back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

Also forgot to add salmon to my fiancÃ©'s salad.  Pretty pitiful service.  I never tip less than 20% ever and I only tipped 10 for this waitress.  We won't be going back.  Beer was good, that's about it and it took 20 minutes to get that.  How they have 5 stars on here I will never know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

On warm summer nights I can hear the drunk patrons of the bar it also has yelling and talking out on the patio. Sometimes I yell at them to shut up. :) I digress. The food is decent, but nothing to really write home about. It's quiet and the servers are great. Other then that, it's pretty much your standard restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td><td>2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

No response, just a blank stare when I finally made it to the order/register after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line.  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow.  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute, I placed an order for french toast.  What I rec'd was certainly different.  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter.  Far too sweet and oily in some way, not butter, but did not taste lard-based either.  Unable to eat all of it, disappointing.  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile, that was nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

       "I, of course, asked for the cheapest shipping method, and he quickly rattled off prices. I settled on the cheapest and proceeded to place my item in a photo mailer that I informed him I would be purchasing. When I asked him to tape the end for me - that's when I got the first eye roll. He did tape it, though, I paid and left. After some confusion on my part, admittedly, I had to go back in to get a different shipping method that would give me a tracking number. By this time, I thought the guy was going to yell at me. The second eye roll came when I asked him if I could cut open my package to remove some packing before weighing the second time. He proceeded to do that himself, I repacked and then asked if the first transaction would be \"refunded after adding the rest up?\" He said, \"Yes,\" and gave me a new total. I charged it and asked for the refund from first transaction. He looked at me, shook his head and laughed when he said, \"O no, that's not refundable.\" \"Why didn't you say so when I asked?!? I would have gone somewhere else!\" Instead, I'm now writing a bad review because I feel ripped off and taken advantage of by a smug employee. His third eye roll came with a shake of his head after I turned to leave. Yeah, I caught that in the reflection. \r\n",
       "It's obvious there's little concern for this business on Ann Road - the owners don't bother to respond to any of the negative reviews they've received.

I walked in customer and I had to wait 5 minutes before I was helped. My nails were placed into the acetone for 15 minutes while the worker was doing a clients pedicure. The atmosphere was okay but the workers like to have conversations across the salon which can be annoying. Overall the salon was decent but I would not get a full set of nails done there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

Food...we had crab cocktail to start ice cold lump crab with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Followed by steak house salad it was a chopped salad if you like blue cheese you will love it. Ice cold salad crunchy bacon,avocado,white French dressing it was good but I will not order again because it is impossible to pick out the blue cheese in a chopped salad :) main coarse we had prime rib king and queens cut. we both ordered medium well. king was more medium rare we had to send it back mine which was much thinner and was perfect. Chris was our server very pleasant informative. The reasons I could not give five stars had to request a water refill, had to return prime rib, sides were sent out wrong. We both ordered potatoes and they tried to give us creamed spinach lol,computers went down when it was time to pay our bill so we had to wait a bit but that stuff happens. Surprise happy anniversary strawberries were a nice touch. All in all we enjoyed our anniversary diviner at Hank's and we look forward to coming back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

       "The employees at the check out area seemed to have a \"I don't really want to help you but I will\". Then came the extras that every place tries to sell you on (damage waiver and fill up gas) the way this was handled is extremely deceiving! I was asked: which do you want of the three choices presented. Lucky for me I know that My insurance company covers me and a rental car. So making it sound as though i have to choice one is simply taking advantage of those who don't know better. Then there was the gas question. Something similar to: the gas will be $2.49. I didn't ask for the details but this usually means either it will cost you $2.49 a gallon for whatever gas it takes to fill the car or usually it is $2.49 a gallon for whatever a full tank would cost no matter how much gas you leave in the car. If you can fill up the car right before turning it in, you will save some $$. Simply tell them, I will fill it up before returning it. This experience would get a 1 rating!\r\n",

We did go from a Ford Fusion Hybrid to a caravan but we didn't have headaches or feel nauseous in the caravan so all was good and they were quick.

However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing. \r\n",

       "The gentleman that did my Ultimate Deluxe Pedicure was quiet, but I appreciated that. The filing was too aggressive at first but once I spoke up he was great! I always find a complaint about the massage being too soft and not looking enough, and here it was great! First pedicure in a year and only 2nd time ever feeling satisfied in my massage!\r\n",

Salad bar offerings didn't look fresh, food oversalted but wholly lacking in flavor. Inordinately long wait for everything. Server NEVER offered refills on drinks. Place isn't particularly clean, either. I waited till I got home because the ladies' room was so nasty. This place was good years ago, I'm told, but it's surely not now. I question the safety of eating here based on all I saw. This included seeing an employee run hands through her hair and go right back to food prep....yuck!!!! But enough, I'll never eat there again. I value my health and safety too much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </td></tr>\n",

I wish I could afford to actually shop here, rather than pop in for a few obscure things every now and then. Some how I tend to gravitate toward the general merchandise (lotions, essential oils, etc.) than I do the actual foods. Food wise, you're obviously going to get a better price elsewhere, but the general stuff is pretty on par price wise, at least from what I've seen.

Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me \\$10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",

So check your bill make sure you don't tip them twice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

There was a gang fight in the lobby my first night there. The hallways reek of cheap perfume. My shower drain didn't work due to it being clogged with hair. My window looked out on the wall of the neighboring hotel. Life is too short to stay at The Quad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

My husband and I both ordered burgers (Guy's signature burger and the Mac n cheese burger) and they were both delicious. The fries were just amazing. Our drinks were good (jack n coke for the husband and some blackberry margarita for me), could have been stronger but still tasty.  The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service was kind of slow and it wasn't super busy.

It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

       "Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!\r\n",

I have had such an awful experience with this particular location! So the first time I went for lens fitting, I was given EXPIRED lens that caused irritation in my eyes!! I went back and was given another trial by Dr. To however I noticed blurry eyes with this particular lens! I went today and discussed my concern with the owner Dr Chiu!! She is the most arrogant and ignorant person I ever met! She disregard my concern and instead of offering a solution to my concern which was blurry vision with this current lenses, she abandon me as the patient by simply refunding me the lens fitting cost!! What kind of ignorant doctor does that!!! She simply said I'm unhappy with their service and shud find another ophthalmologist! She disregard my concern and got rid of me instead!! She told me that I need to start from scratch!! Thanks for wasting my time then!

I would never expect a place so unassuming, to provide such an authentic and inspiring meal.  Located at the corner of Missouri and 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ The French Grocery offers fine French food at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  It features a small sitting area, that starts it's day as a lively cafe offering fine pastries and strong coffee, then thoughtfully ending it, serving a beautiful dinner every evening.\r\n",
       "     My first dinner visit I had the pleasure of enjoying the Trout Amandine.  It was a beautifully cooked piece of trout breaded in almond flour, served with asparagus and think sliced potatoes cooked in butter.  The flavors we're outrageous and I could barely hold myself back for another bite.  Everything about it screamed classic French, from the rich butter sauce that the trout was served in, to the moist of fish wrapped in a crunchy almond flour crust.  I was just blown away.\r\n",

The front office only seemed to care about whether or not my pain was from a car accident and how they could maximize their billing.   The treatment itself was also not effective and I never felt any change from their service.  Again, they mostly just wanted to maximize how much they could get from me and from the insurance carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!\r\n",

       "I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.\r\n",

We were. It sure what to expect . We found a Groupon after we decided on this exact location which was a nice bonus . We did the \"wrongfully accused \" room which was fun and semi challenging .

Staff is friendly and we got seated immediately. Ordered the home made ice cream and it was delicious. The batter of the waffle was excellent and not over cooked or hard like some places. Only thing I found was a bit lacking is the amount of fruit they give you on your waffle order which costs like \\$8+ ... it was a bit lacking felt like all I ate was ice cream and pretty much the waffle for the price. Just a tip, ensure u at least be a bit more generous on your fruit portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",

I eat out alot and have traveled around the world eating Italian  food,  excluding Italy. This wasn't the worst meal I had but it was pretty close. The waiter was very friendly and it seemed very talkative,  too talkative. He also tended to hover alot at the the table, maybe because the place was verually empty on a Friday night. This should have been the sign that the food wasn't very good! He mentioned that the chef was trained in Europe of Michelin star resturant and that the pasta was made on sight and that all the ingredients where freshly sourced from local producers daily. Maybe he worked at the Michelin tires store in Europe not a resturant! These other people that gave this place a five star rating either don't eat out much or diffentaly had something else, not the pasta I had. The waiter said that the poritions weren't  small like most fancy resturants but a good size, they were small!!!!!

My wife had King Key rekey one door and install a new deadbolt. Should have been about \\$100. We were charged \\$540!! I had to have another company come out and fix the deadbolt because it was installed incorrectly by King Key.This is outrageous!

I really want this place to do well, however, as I think they have a lot of potential with a mostly untapped market in The Annex.  Hopefully consistently improves as they go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

It's not flashy and it won't wow you, but it will leave you satisfied.  We were shopping at Square 1 and were looking for a Chinese restaurant near by.  Having a Chatime in the same plaza also helps!\r\n",

One thing I got to say is the portions here are very good!!  My GF and little one shared their plate and could only really manage a little more than half.  You will get your value here, that's for sure.  The dishes themselves were what you expect, nothing special but nothing bad as well.  \r\n",

The first full set I received here was great and lasted about 10 days.  After that, each fill was only lasting 5-7 days.  I then upgraded to their unlimited membership as I was having to go so often.  I am attaching a picture of my eyelashes 4 days after a fill.  I have been having my lashes done for two years and I have never experienced such poor retention in fills.  Furthermore, I called their number to cancel an appointment as I was fed up.  I was now just emailed that they charged me 50\\% of an appointment for not cancelling.

There were 3 people in our party and 2 were served our meals with the last person in the party never getting his meal. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come back and let us know something about our 3rd persons meal. When he didn't appear, we approached the bar ourselves. He assured us the meal had been ordered and would be out soon. The meal finally shows up, as the rest of the parties empty dishes were being cleared. When requesting other items that should've came with the meal, we waited another 15 minutes. Check out process was another 20 mins.. Probably won't be back. Sad because I had high hopes for this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

We should have known .. but we tried it anyway as we left because of no service and walked over to Harolds which had a 40 minute wait for 2, and then went back.  The service at the bar was horrible (we sat there FOREVER before one of the cranky bartenders asked what we needed), the food was God awful (Had the French Dip -- was the worst I've ever had)and the drinks were SUPER weak and expensive.  Then we waited FOREVER for our food and again, the place was EMPTY.   Not to mention the stupid menu's they have.  I would think it shouldn't be open for business much longer.  Oh, maybe the bartenders would cheer up if they didn't have to lug their own cases of beer up from the back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

Also forgot to add salmon to my fiancÃ©'s salad.  Pretty pitiful service.  I never tip less than 20\\% ever and I only tipped 10 for this waitress.  We won't be going back.  Beer was good, that's about it and it took 20 minutes to get that.  How they have 5 stars on here I will never know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

On warm summer nights I can hear the drunk patrons of the bar it also has yelling and talking out on the patio. Sometimes I yell at them to shut up. :) I digress. The food is decent, but nothing to really write home about. It's quiet and the servers are great. Other then that, it's pretty much your standard restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

No response, just a blank stare when I finally made it to the order/register after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line.  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow.  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute, I placed an order for french toast.  What I rec'd was certainly different.  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter.  Far too sweet and oily in some way, not butter, but did not taste lard-based either.  Unable to eat all of it, disappointing.  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile, that was nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

       "I, of course, asked for the cheapest shipping method, and he quickly rattled off prices. I settled on the cheapest and proceeded to place my item in a photo mailer that I informed him I would be purchasing. When I asked him to tape the end for me - that's when I got the first eye roll. He did tape it, though, I paid and left. After some confusion on my part, admittedly, I had to go back in to get a different shipping method that would give me a tracking number. By this time, I thought the guy was going to yell at me. The second eye roll came when I asked him if I could cut open my package to remove some packing before weighing the second time. He proceeded to do that himself, I repacked and then asked if the first transaction would be \"refunded after adding the rest up?\" He said, \"Yes,\" and gave me a new total. I charged it and asked for the refund from first transaction. He looked at me, shook his head and laughed when he said, \"O no, that's not refundable.\" \"Why didn't you say so when I asked?!? I would have gone somewhere else!\" Instead, I'm now writing a bad review because I feel ripped off and taken advantage of by a smug employee. His third eye roll came with a shake of his head after I turned to leave. Yeah, I caught that in the reflection. \r\n",
       "It's obvious there's little concern for this business on Ann Road - the owners don't bother to respond to any of the negative reviews they've received.

I walked in customer and I had to wait 5 minutes before I was helped. My nails were placed into the acetone for 15 minutes while the worker was doing a clients pedicure. The atmosphere was okay but the workers like to have conversations across the salon which can be annoying. Overall the salon was decent but I would not get a full set of nails done there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

Food...we had crab cocktail to start ice cold lump crab with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Followed by steak house salad it was a chopped salad if you like blue cheese you will love it. Ice cold salad crunchy bacon,avocado,white French dressing it was good but I will not order again because it is impossible to pick out the blue cheese in a chopped salad :) main coarse we had prime rib king and queens cut. we both ordered medium well. king was more medium rare we had to send it back mine which was much thinner and was perfect. Chris was our server very pleasant informative. The reasons I could not give five stars had to request a water refill, had to return prime rib, sides were sent out wrong. We both ordered potatoes and they tried to give us creamed spinach lol,computers went down when it was time to pay our bill so we had to wait a bit but that stuff happens. Surprise happy anniversary strawberries were a nice touch. All in all we enjoyed our anniversary diviner at Hank's and we look forward to coming back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

       "The employees at the check out area seemed to have a \"I don't really want to help you but I will\". Then came the extras that every place tries to sell you on (damage waiver and fill up gas) the way this was handled is extremely deceiving! I was asked: which do you want of the three choices presented. Lucky for me I know that My insurance company covers me and a rental car. So making it sound as though i have to choice one is simply taking advantage of those who don't know better. Then there was the gas question. Something similar to: the gas will be \\$2.49. I didn't ask for the details but this usually means either it will cost you \\$2.49 a gallon for whatever gas it takes to fill the car or usually it is \\$2.49 a gallon for whatever a full tank would cost no matter how much gas you leave in the car. If you can fill up the car right before turning it in, you will save some \\$\\$. Simply tell them, I will fill it up before returning it. This experience would get a 1 rating!\r\n",

       "The gentleman that did my Ultimate Deluxe Pedicure was quiet, but I appreciated that. The filing was too aggressive at first but once I spoke up he was great! I always find a complaint about the massage being too soft and not looking enough, and here it was great! First pedicure in a year and only 2nd time ever feeling satisfied in my massage!\r\n",

Salad bar offerings didn't look fresh, food oversalted but wholly lacking in flavor. Inordinately long wait for everything. Server NEVER offered refills on drinks. Place isn't particularly clean, either. I waited till I got home because the ladies' room was so nasty. This place was good years ago, I'm told, but it's surely not now. I question the safety of eating here based on all I saw. This included seeing an employee run hands through her hair and go right back to food prep....yuck!!!! But enough, I'll never eat there again. I value my health and safety too much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

I wish I could afford to actually shop here, rather than pop in for a few obscure things every now and then. Some how I tend to gravitate toward the general merchandise (lotions, essential oils, etc.) than I do the actual foods. Food wise, you're obviously going to get a better price elsewhere, but the general stuff is pretty on par price wise, at least from what I've seen. Back at Christmas time, I was looking for some food-grade vegetable glycerin to make vanilla extract with and it was the same price here as it was online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me $10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

My window looked out on the wall of the neighboring hotel. Life is too short to stay at The Quad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

La variÃ©tÃ© astronomique d'accessoire vient assurÃ©ment ajouter des Ã©toiles au cahier. Sombreros, tricornes, fez, haute-formes, melons, le choix des chapeaux est incommensurable. Idem pour les perruques pour hommes et pour femmes; vous en trouverez de toutes les couleurs et tous les volumes, allant des sulfureuses coiffures de vamp aux Â«coupes LongueuilÂ» trÃ¨s stÃ©rÃ©otypÃ©es...\r\n",

My husband and I both ordered burgers (Guy's signature burger and the Mac n cheese burger) and they were both delicious. The fries were just amazing. Our drinks were good (jack n coke for the husband and some blackberry margarita for me), could have been stronger but still tasty.  The only reason I gave 4/5 is because the service was kind of slow and it wasn't super busy. But we'll definitely be back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

You get a very \"home,\" old school Italian feel as soon as you enter. You can order anything off of the menu, and you will love it! Free wine, garlic bread, and a cappuccino with every meal.

It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

       "Following appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!\r\n",

I have had such an awful experience with this particular location! So the first time I went for lens fitting, I was given EXPIRED lens that caused irritation in my eyes!! I went back and was given another trial by Dr. To however I noticed blurry eyes with this particular lens! I went today and discussed my concern with the owner Dr Chiu!! She is the most arrogant and ignorant person I ever met! She disregard my concern and instead of offering a solution to my concern which was blurry vision with this current lenses, she abandon me as the patient by simply refunding me the lens fitting cost!! What kind of ignorant doctor does that!!! She simply said I'm unhappy with their service and shud find another ophthalmologist! She disregard my concern and got rid of me instead!! She told me that I need to start from scratch!! Thanks for wasting my time then!

I would never expect a place so unassuming, to provide such an authentic and inspiring meal.  Located at the corner of Missouri and 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ The French Grocery offers fine French food at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  It features a small sitting area, that starts it's day as a lively cafe offering fine pastries and strong coffee, then thoughtfully ending it, serving a beautiful dinner every evening.\r\n",
       "     My first dinner visit I had the pleasure of enjoying the Trout Amandine.  It was a beautifully cooked piece of trout breaded in almond flour, served with asparagus and think sliced potatoes cooked in butter.  The flavors we're outrageous and I could barely hold myself back for another bite.  Everything about it screamed classic French, from the rich butter sauce that the trout was served in, to the moist of fish wrapped in a crunchy almond flour crust.  I was just blown away.\r\n",

The front office only seemed to care about whether or not my pain was from a car accident and how they could maximize their billing.   The treatment itself was also not effective and I never felt any change from their service.  Again, they mostly just wanted to maximize how much they could get from me and from the insurance carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!\r\n",

       "I ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.\r\n",

We were. It sure what to expect . We found a Groupon after we decided on this exact location which was a nice bonus . We did the \"wrongfully accused \" room which was fun and semi challenging .

Staff is friendly and we got seated immediately. Ordered the home made ice cream and it was delicious. The batter of the waffle was excellent and not over cooked or hard like some places. Only thing I found was a bit lacking is the amount of fruit they give you on your waffle order which costs like $8+ ... it was a bit lacking felt like all I ate was ice cream and pretty much the waffle for the price. Just a tip, ensure u at least be a bit more generous on your fruit portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

I eat out alot and have traveled around the world eating Italian  food,  excluding Italy. This wasn't the worst meal I had but it was pretty close. The waiter was very friendly and it seemed very talkative,  too talkative. He also tended to hover alot at the the table, maybe because the place was verually empty on a Friday night. This should have been the sign that the food wasn't very good! He mentioned that the chef was trained in Europe of Michelin star resturant and that the pasta was made on sight and that all the ingredients where freshly sourced from local producers daily. Maybe he worked at the Michelin tires store in Europe not a resturant! These other people that gave this place a five star rating either don't eat out much or diffentaly had something else, not the pasta I had. The waiter said that the poritions weren't  small like most fancy resturants but a good size, they were small!!!!!

My wife had King Key rekey one door and install a new deadbolt. Should have been about $100. We were charged $540!! I had to have another company come out and fix the deadbolt because it was installed incorrectly by King Key.This is outrageous! I am a local small business owner and King Key took advantage of my wife's lack of knowledge about what this should have cost.

I really want this place to do well, however, as I think they have a lot of potential with a mostly untapped market in The Annex.  Hopefully consistently improves as they go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n",

It's not flashy and it won't wow you, but it will leave you satisfied.  We were shopping at Square 1 and were looking for a Chinese restaurant near by.  Having a Chatime in the same plaza also helps!\r\n",

One thing I got to say is the portions here are very good!!  My GF and little one shared their plate and could only really manage a little more than half.  You will get your value here, that's for sure.  The dishes themselves were what you expect, nothing special but nothing bad as well.  \r\n",

The first full set I received here was great and lasted about 10 days.  After that, each fill was only lasting 5-7 days.  I then upgraded to their unlimited membership as I was having to go so often.  I am attaching a picture of my eyelashes 4 days after a fill.  I have been having my lashes done for two years and I have never experienced such poor retention in fills.  Furthermore, I called their number to cancel an appointment as I was fed up.  I was now just emailed that they charged me 50% of an appointment for not cancelling.

There were 3 people in our party and 2 were served our meals with the last person in the party never getting his meal. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come back and let us know something about our 3rd persons meal. When he didn't appear, we approached the bar ourselves. He assured us the meal had been ordered and would be out soon. The meal finally shows up, as the rest of the parties empty dishes were being cleared. When requesting other items that should've came with the meal, we waited another 15 minutes. Check out process was another 20 mins.. Probably won't be back. Sad because I had high hopes for this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

We should have known .. but we tried it anyway as we left because of no service and walked over to Harolds which had a 40 minute wait for 2, and then went back.  The service at the bar was horrible (we sat there FOREVER before one of the cranky bartenders asked what we needed), the food was God awful (Had the French Dip -- was the worst I've ever had)and the drinks were SUPER weak and expensive.  Then we waited FOREVER for our food and again, the place was EMPTY.   Not to mention the stupid menu's they have.  I would think it shouldn't be open for business much longer.  Oh, maybe the bartenders would cheer up if they didn't have to lug their own cases of beer up from the back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Also forgot to add salmon to my fiancÃ©'s salad.  Pretty pitiful service.  I never tip less than 20% ever and I only tipped 10 for this waitress.  We won't be going back.  Beer was good, that's about it and it took 20 minutes to get that.  How they have 5 stars on here I will never know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

On warm summer nights I can hear the drunk patrons of the bar it also has yelling and talking out on the patio. Sometimes I yell at them to shut up. :) I digress. The food is decent, but nothing to really write home about. It's quiet and the servers are great. Other then that, it's pretty much your standard restaurant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

No response, just a blank stare when I finally made it to the order/register after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line.  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow.  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute, I placed an order for french toast.  What I rec'd was certainly different.  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter.  Far too sweet and oily in some way, not butter, but did not taste lard-based either.  Unable to eat all of it, disappointing.  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile, that was nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

       "I, of course, asked for the cheapest shipping method, and he quickly rattled off prices. I settled on the cheapest and proceeded to place my item in a photo mailer that I informed him I would be purchasing. When I asked him to tape the end for me - that's when I got the first eye roll. He did tape it, though, I paid and left. After some confusion on my part, admittedly, I had to go back in to get a different shipping method that would give me a tracking number. By this time, I thought the guy was going to yell at me. The second eye roll came when I asked him if I could cut open my package to remove some packing before weighing the second time. He proceeded to do that himself, I repacked and then asked if the first transaction would be \"refunded after adding the rest up?\" He said, \"Yes,\" and gave me a new total. I charged it and asked for the refund from first transaction. He looked at me, shook his head and laughed when he said, \"O no, that's not refundable.\" \"Why didn't you say so when I asked?!? I would have gone somewhere else!\" Instead, I'm now writing a bad review because I feel ripped off and taken advantage of by a smug employee. His third eye roll came with a shake of his head after I turned to leave. Yeah, I caught that in the reflection. \r\n",
       "It's obvious there's little concern for this business on Ann Road - the owners don't bother to respond to any of the negative reviews they've received.

I walked in customer and I had to wait 5 minutes before I was helped. My nails were placed into the acetone for 15 minutes while the worker was doing a clients pedicure. The atmosphere was okay but the workers like to have conversations across the salon which can be annoying. Overall the salon was decent but I would not get a full set of nails done there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

Food...we had crab cocktail to start ice cold lump crab with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Followed by steak house salad it was a chopped salad if you like blue cheese you will love it. Ice cold salad crunchy bacon,avocado,white French dressing it was good but I will not order again because it is impossible to pick out the blue cheese in a chopped salad :) main coarse we had prime rib king and queens cut. we both ordered medium well. king was more medium rare we had to send it back mine which was much thinner and was perfect. Chris was our server very pleasant informative. The reasons I could not give five stars had to request a water refill, had to return prime rib, sides were sent out wrong. We both ordered potatoes and they tried to give us creamed spinach lol,computers went down when it was time to pay our bill so we had to wait a bit but that stuff happens. Surprise happy anniversary strawberries were a nice touch. All in all we enjoyed our anniversary diviner at Hank's and we look forward to coming back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

       "The employees at the check out area seemed to have a \"I don't really want to help you but I will\". Then came the extras that every place tries to sell you on (damage waiver and fill up gas) the way this was handled is extremely deceiving! I was asked: which do you want of the three choices presented. Lucky for me I know that My insurance company covers me and a rental car. So making it sound as though i have to choice one is simply taking advantage of those who don't know better. Then there was the gas question. Something similar to: the gas will be $2.49. I didn't ask for the details but this usually means either it will cost you $2.49 a gallon for whatever gas it takes to fill the car or usually it is $2.49 a gallon for whatever a full tank would cost no matter how much gas you leave in the car. If you can fill up the car right before turning it in, you will save some $$. Simply tell them, I will fill it up before returning it. This experience would get a 1 rating!\r\n",

We did go from a Ford Fusion Hybrid to a caravan but we didn't have headaches or feel nauseous in the caravan so all was good and they were quick.

       "The gentleman that did my Ultimate Deluxe Pedicure was quiet, but I appreciated that. The filing was too aggressive at first but once I spoke up he was great! I always find a complaint about the massage being too soft and not looking enough, and here it was great! First pedicure in a year and only 2nd time ever feeling satisfied in my massage!\r\n",

Salad bar offerings didn't look fresh, food oversalted but wholly lacking in flavor. Inordinately long wait for everything. Server NEVER offered refills on drinks. Place isn't particularly clean, either. I waited till I got home because the ladies' room was so nasty. This place was good years ago, I'm told, but it's surely not now. I question the safety of eating here based on all I saw. This included seeing an employee run hands through her hair and go right back to food prep....yuck!!!! But enough, I'll never eat there again. I value my health and safety too much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

I wish I could afford to actually shop here, rather than pop in for a few obscure things every now and then. Some how I tend to gravitate toward the general merchandise (lotions, essential oils, etc.) than I do the actual foods. Food wise, you're obviously going to get a better price elsewhere, but the general stuff is pretty on par price wise, at least from what I've seen. Back at Christmas time, I was looking for some food-grade vegetable glycerin to make vanilla extract with and it was the same price here as it was online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

       "169217 Would have given 0 stars.  Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me $10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "48953  The food was good but I didn't like the fact they added the tip in the bill when I had only a party of four I can understand if I had a party of 6 or more.

       "579239 Filthy, overpriced, ghetto. There was a gang fight in the lobby my first night there. The hallways reek of cheap perfume. My shower drain didn't work due to it being clogged with hair.

       "459946 This is a treasure amongst the flashing lights and sounds of Las Vegas. You get a very \"home,\" old school Italian feel as soon as you enter. You can order anything off of the menu, and you will love it! Free wine, garlic bread, and a cappuccino with every meal. You might think they are overpriced, but wait until you see your meal! You definitely get what you pay for!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "145839 This is one of my favorite bars, its a cool relaxed environment. It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "612587 We went to Origin India last night after hearing they've brought in a new chef from the UK who was supposedly awesome. Well, they were right.  Presentation and tons of flavor - not what we are used to seeing at Indian restaurants out here in Vegas. This review really teeters around 4.5 stars...\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started off with the Chicken Chili Stir fry and Lamb Seekh Kabob. Both had intense flavor and were SPICY (just the way we asked for it). \\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing appetizers, we had the Chicken Makhani and Rogan Josh. The chicken makhani was buttery -- just the way it should be! Now, I'm not too big of a lamb fan because of the weird gamey aftertaste it has but the Rogan Josh was out of this world. Tender, boneless and unbelievable. The naan was nice and fluffy (not the burnt kind you see at other Indian joints). They served us a plate of onions, lemons and chilies without us even having to ask!\\r\\n\\r\\nI also ordered a side of okra which is my favorite vegetarian dish. It was good but not as great as my dad makes :)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chef served us a complimentary dessert which was a little piece of heaven. Saffron poached pear with vanilla ice cream and an orange panacotta. Out of this world!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husband is not a fan of eating Indian food in restaurants since it's never up to our standards; however, he said we would be back to Origin India very soon! Kudos to Chef Kuldeep Singh!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "183674 The review applies to the optometric office at LensCrafters! I have had such an awful experience with this particular location! So the first time I went for lens fitting, I was given EXPIRED lens that caused irritation in my eyes!! I went back and was given another trial by Dr. To however I noticed blurry eyes with this particular lens! I went today and discussed my concern with the owner Dr Chiu!! She is the most arrogant and ignorant person I ever met! She disregard my concern and instead of offering a solution to my concern which was blurry vision with this current lenses, she abandon me as the patient by simply refunding me the lens fitting cost!! What kind of ignorant doctor does that!!! She simply said I'm unhappy with their service and shud find another ophthalmologist! She disregard my concern and got rid of me instead!! She told me that I need to start from scratch!! Thanks for wasting my time then! Stop giving your patient expired lenses so all this could have been avoided!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "543386 The French Grocery is a classic example of \"try it to believe it\".  I would never expect a place so unassuming, to provide such an authentic and inspiring meal.  Located at the corner of Missouri and 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ The French Grocery offers fine French food at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  It features a small sitting area, that starts it's day as a lively cafe offering fine pastries and strong coffee, then thoughtfully ending it, serving a beautiful dinner every evening.\\r\\n     My first dinner visit I had the pleasure of enjoying the Trout Amandine.  It was a beautifully cooked piece of trout breaded in almond flour, served with asparagus and think sliced potatoes cooked in butter.  The flavors we're outrageous and I could barely hold myself back for another bite.  Everything about it screamed classic French, from the rich butter sauce that the trout was served in, to the moist of fish wrapped in a crunchy almond flour crust.

       "8472   My experience was the same as the first review.   The front office only seemed to care about whether or not my pain was from a car accident and how they could maximize their billing.   The treatment itself was also not effective and I never felt any change from their service.  Again, they mostly just wanted to maximize how much they could get from me and from the insurance carriers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "87179  Best fried chicken ever!!! The issue I persistently have with chicken is that it is not usually well seasoned. But the chicken at this place was wonderfully well seasoned. I mean even the bits closest to the bone are just as well seasoned as the surface meat. So every bite was absolutely delicious! It was very tender and moist  and not overly greasy. I come from the South and I have not had better fried chicken!\\r\\n\\r\\nI ordered their Blue plate. I was doubtful about spiced watermelon with chicken. (I mean watermelon on a main dish with chicken?!?). But once I had it, it totally made sense! The sweetness and juiciness of watermelon goes delightfully with the fried chicken; it kinda acts as a palette cleanser and takes away any feeling of greasiness. Totally yum! Honestly, I think I'd always try fried chicken with watermelon after this. Don't be put off by this unusual combo! The spiced watermelon isn't overly spiced. I tasted salt, pepper and cilantro. It's very refreshing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly issue: portion sizes are little small compared to the usual American size portions.

After being glared at, talked to rudely, and ignored on several occasions, he finally was SO rude to a friend and I  that we are never going back there (and neither are any of my other friends).  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you don't mind being treated like THEY are doing YOU a favor by deigning to serve you, then this place might be fine for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "262467 Oh. MY. GOD. \\r\\n\\r\\nI STILL do not have my cat's meds. Why? Because THEY sent it to the wrong address. But is that the end of it? They'll resend it right away? \\r\\n\\r\\nNO. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I could give ZERO I would. \\r\\n\\r\\nI get a rude CSR (janine? Janet?) who informs me that they'll \"look into it\" and call me back about it. And proceeds to GRILL ME about when I called and when I changed the address, etc. Then put me on hold for the third time. \\r\\n\\r\\nTHEN when  Janice or whatever her name was comes back and I tell her I don't know what the problem is ON THEIR END, they just need to get me the meds, she gets rude and says, YOU NEED TO TALK TO MY SUPERVISOR and slams me onto hold AGAIN. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen the supervisor does the same thing!! OMG! I can't believe I was just treated like this! Amazing. In a BAD way. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what has happened to Roadrunner, but just don't bother with them. They clearly have plenty of customers and don't need any more, nor do they need to keep ones like me who've spent $1000s with them over the years. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnless you love abuse, don't use these people.

       "610974 Was our whole groups first time doing any type of escape room . We were. It sure what to expect . We found a Groupon after we decided on this exact location which was a nice bonus . We did the \"wrongfully accused \" room which was fun and semi challenging . The room was a little wore out which I feel could have been updated or cleaned up just a tad bit . Overall though we had a great time and now have a hunger for more different extravagant escape rooms .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "52486  Great service.  Staff is friendly and we got seated immediately. Ordered the home made ice cream and it was delicious. The batter of the waffle was excellent and not over cooked or hard like some places. Only thing I found was a bit lacking is the amount of fruit they give you on your waffle order which costs like $8+ ... it was a bit lacking felt like all I ate was ice cream and pretty much the waffle for the price. Just a tip, ensure u at least be a bit more generous on your fruit portions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "273599 Went to Angelino for dinner last night with a friend and wasn't very happy with the food. I eat out alot and have traveled around the world eating Italian  food,  excluding Italy. This wasn't the worst meal I had but it was pretty close. The waiter was very friendly and it seemed very talkative,  too talkative. He also tended to hover alot at the the table, maybe because the place was verually empty on a Friday night. This should have been the sign that the food wasn't very good! He mentioned that the chef was trained in Europe of Michelin star resturant and that the pasta was made on sight and that all the ingredients where freshly sourced from local producers daily. Maybe he worked at the Michelin tires store in Europe not a resturant! These other people that gave this place a five star rating either don't eat out much or diffentaly had something else, not the pasta I had. The waiter said that the poritions weren't  small like most fancy resturants but a good size, they were small!!!!! Save your money and go somewhere else to eat!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "247596 If I could give negative stars I would. My wife had King Key rekey one door and install a new deadbolt. Should have been about $100. We were charged $540!! I had to have another company come out and fix the deadbolt because it was installed incorrectly by King Key.This is outrageous! I am a local small business owner and King Key took advantage of my wife's lack of knowledge about what this should have cost.

       "71959  Been here several times since they opened for takeout...back now in Toronto, and not sure if I would visit Bang Bang again, to tell the truth as already it's become a bit lackluster in my opinion....service is friendly and personable, but I've learned that portion size largely depends on who's preparing your meal, and depending on who you get is *what* you get....so lack of consistency loses major points for me and makes me start to resent a place pretty quickly.  I really want this place to do well, however, as I think they have a lot of potential with a mostly untapped market in The Annex.

       "41534  This appears to be a normal bowling alley. I have not been in one in awhile, but it had the usual TV screens over the lanes and electronic scoring. This was league night and everything was organized on the bowling alley part just fine, including shoes, which still come in silly colors.\\r\\n\\r\\n    It only gets three stars because they have no Happy Hour and a freakin pitcher of domestic beer costs $14. Might smuggle a sixer in next time to avoid this assault on my wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "5204   Pros:\\r\\nPretty extensive menu\\r\\nPortions are good\\r\\n\\r\\nCons:\\r\\nYou won't be amazed by anything\\r\\n\\r\\nMacey's is your typical Chinese diner if you ask me.  If you're craving Chinese food, this place will get the job done.  It's not flashy and it won't wow you, but it will leave you satisfied.  We were shopping at Square 1 and were looking for a Chinese restaurant near by.  Having a Chatime in the same plaza also helps!\\r\\n\\r\\nMacey's doesn't look big from the outside but when you walk inside, there's a lot of tables here.  They don't seem to have to many tables that can fit parties of 6 or more though. I counted about 3 of about 30 or so tables that could fit.  Just be wary if you come with a big group.\\r\\n\\r\\nMacey's has your regular offerings for a Chinese restaurant but it also has items you would find at a HK style cafe as well.  There are some western items as well just to fill out the menu.  All in all, there should be something for everyone here.  We were feeling rice noodles so we ordered two of those to share.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWe ordered beef rice noodles with veggies and another rice noodle with beef and XO sauce.  They were not busy at the time we came so the dishes come out very quickly.  One thing I got to say is the portions here are very good!!  My GF and little one shared their plate and could only really manage a little more than half.  You will get your value here, that's for sure.  The dishes themselves were what you expect, nothing special but nothing bad as well.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you're feeling Chinese and in the Mississauga region, this place is a safe choice.  It won't wow you but you know what to expect.  I would recommend this place to people looking for a decent meal with out breaking the bank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "84318  There are a handful of up-scale restaurants in the local strip shopping centers; one becomes used to burgers or sandwiches.   But this is among the few that have food, a more-than-average wine list, and that blessedly quiet atmosphere that soothes (and yes, sometimes live entertainment! ), for a couples dinner or a peaceful dinner for any number to enjoy.\\r\\n  Chef Rudy is personable and the staff is quietly attentive.  I would compare this experience to Sonoma Cellar or Fuego, without the parking a mile away or the noisy casino to trek through.   And no waiting. \\r\\n   Definitely worth a first visit.

       "369768 I previously gave a wonderful review as Amber was so great removing a bad lash job.  The first full set I received here was great and lasted about 10 days.  After that, each fill was only lasting 5-7 days.  I then upgraded to their unlimited membership as I was having to go so often.  I am attaching a picture of my eyelashes 4 days after a fill.  I have been having my lashes done for two years and I have never experienced such poor retention in fills.  Furthermore, I called their number to cancel an appointment as I was fed up.  I was now just emailed that they charged me 50% of an appointment for not cancelling.

       "577738 Great food but we sat at the bar to take advantage of the 30% off happy hour drinks and I have to say that the service was way below average. There were 3 people in our party and 2 were served our meals with the last person in the party never getting his meal. We waited and waited and waited for the waiter to come back and let us know something about our 3rd persons meal. When he didn't appear, we approached the bar ourselves. He assured us the meal had been ordered and would be out soon. The meal finally shows up, as the rest of the parties empty dishes were being cleared. When requesting other items that should've came with the meal, we waited another 15 minutes. Check out process was another 20 mins.. Probably won't be back. Sad because I had high hopes for this place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "400278 Its no wonder this place was DEAD on a Friday night and every other restaurant/bar around it was packed!!  We should have known .. but we tried it anyway as we left because of no service and walked over to Harolds which had a 40 minute wait for 2, and then went back.  The service at the bar was horrible (we sat there FOREVER before one of the cranky bartenders asked what we needed), the food was God awful (Had the French Dip -- was the worst I've ever had)and the drinks were SUPER weak and expensive.  Then we waited FOREVER for our food and again, the place was EMPTY.   Not to mention the stupid menu's they have.  I would think it shouldn't be open for business much longer.  Oh, maybe the bartenders would cheer up if they didn't have to lug their own cases of beer up from the back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "72626  Wings were terrible, we only got 5 instead of 6 and waitress said would discount them and forgot.  Also forgot to add salmon to my fiancÃ©'s salad.  Pretty pitiful service.  I never tip less than 20% ever and I only tipped 10 for this waitress.  We won't be going back.  Beer was good, that's about it and it took 20 minutes to get that.

       "456343 After running some errands in the area, I had 10 minutes to grab lunch and get back to work. This Subway was convenient for me to swing into so I stopped for a sandwich to go. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one customer ahead of me that was getting a toasted sandwich. I did not want my sandwich toasted, and rather then making me wait for the first customers order to be complete, as some places will sometimes do, they finished my sandwich first which I appreciated. \\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, nothing special about this place but nothing bad either. Just your standard Subway sandwich buying experience. I would probably stop back by if I was in the area and wanted a sandwich for lunch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "37749  I worked in the area so for a few years this was my designated Target, but without that, it wouldn't have been.  I always found it to be a bit less clean than most other Targets I visited.  I was often surprised when they didn't have things that I'd seen at other locations.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTheir seasonal section was only about 1/2 the size of the one on Baseline, and even smaller than the one at Paradise Valley mall (Yes, as a matter of a fact, I am a Target connoisseur.)  Their clothing selection was ok, but again felt a bit smaller than some other spots.  They never seemed to have the best of the new clothing collections either.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, it was a great place to go for your basics.  New t-shirt, laundry detergent, some greeting cards, Air Filters, shampoo, a loaf of bread, vitamins and a new plant for the office.

       "578264 I live about a minute away from this restaurant. On warm summer nights I can hear the drunk patrons of the bar it also has yelling and talking out on the patio. Sometimes I yell at them to shut up. :) I digress. The food is decent, but nothing to really write home about. It's quiet and the servers are great.

       "113573 Hmm, not good.  No response, just a blank stare when I finally made it to the order/register after waiting behind some giggly folks that were pointing and talking about the pastries while not really in line.  Should have another way to view the display case so people can browse and not disrupt the flow.  Upon final discovery that the order girl was not deaf mute, I placed an order for french toast.  What I rec'd was certainly different.  It is made like a monkey bread casserole with globs of korintje cinnamon and maybe an egg or two somewhere in the batter.  Far too sweet and oily in some way, not butter, but did not taste lard-based either.  Unable to eat all of it, disappointing.  The dining attendant was personable and had a great smile, that was nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "356367 I've been searching for a decent UPS store to use for my business, and I have crossed this one off for good. I obviously disturbed the young man behind the counter as he seemed exasperated from the moment I walked in and was preoccupied with something else in the back of the store. This was my first bad sign.\\r\\nI, of course, asked for the cheapest shipping method, and he quickly rattled off prices. I settled on the cheapest and proceeded to place my item in a photo mailer that I informed him I would be purchasing. When I asked him to tape the end for me - that's when I got the first eye roll. He did tape it, though, I paid and left. After some confusion on my part, admittedly, I had to go back in to get a different shipping method that would give me a tracking number. By this time, I thought the guy was going to yell at me. The second eye roll came when I asked him if I could cut open my package to remove some packing before weighing the second time. He proceeded to do that himself, I repacked and then asked if the first transaction would be \"refunded after adding the rest up?\" He said, \"Yes,\" and gave me a new total. I charged it and asked for the refund from first transaction. He looked at me, shook his head and laughed when he said, \"O no, that's not refundable.\" \"Why didn't you say so when I asked?!? I would have gone somewhere else!\" Instead, I'm now writing a bad review because I feel ripped off and taken advantage of by a smug employee. His third eye roll came with a shake of his head after I turned to leave. Yeah, I caught that in the reflection. \\r\\nIt's obvious there's little concern for this business on Ann Road - the owners don't bother to respond to any of the negative reviews they've received. Do yourself (and me, really) a favor and take your business where you will be valued instead of ripped off!                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "54816  It was first time going to this nail salon it was okay considering I only went there to take of my acrylic nails. I walked in customer and I had to wait 5 minutes before I was helped. My nails were placed into the acetone for 15 minutes while the worker was doing a clients pedicure. The atmosphere was okay but the workers like to have conversations across the salon which can be annoying. Overall the salon was decent but I would not get a full set of nails done there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "303199 Anniversary dinner at Hank's atmosphere was old school Vegas elegance loved it. Food...we had crab cocktail to start ice cold lump crab with 2 delicious dipping sauces. Followed by steak house salad it was a chopped salad if you like blue cheese you will love it. Ice cold salad crunchy bacon,avocado,white French dressing it was good but I will not order again because it is impossible to pick out the blue cheese in a chopped salad :) main coarse we had prime rib king and queens cut. we both ordered medium well. king was more medium rare we had to send it back mine which was much thinner and was perfect. Chris was our server very pleasant informative. The reasons I could not give five stars had to request a water refill, had to return prime rib, sides were sent out wrong. We both ordered potatoes and they tried to give us creamed spinach lol,computers went down when it was time to pay our bill so we had to wait a bit but that stuff happens. Surprise happy anniversary strawberries were a nice touch. All in all we enjoyed our anniversary diviner at Hank's and we look forward to coming back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "563844 Website and Price:\\r\\nFinding a car to rent was easy and I actually got the car I reserved. The price was great! This would rate a 5!\\r\\n\\r\\nPicking up car:\\r\\nThe employees at the check out area seemed to have a \"I don't really want to help you but I will\". Then came the extras that every place tries to sell you on (damage waiver and fill up gas) the way this was handled is extremely deceiving! I was asked: which do you want of the three choices presented. Lucky for me I know that My insurance company covers me and a rental car. So making it sound as though i have to choice one is simply taking advantage of those who don't know better. Then there was the gas question. Something similar to: the gas will be $2.49. I didn't ask for the details but this usually means either it will cost you $2.49 a gallon for whatever gas it takes to fill the car or usually it is $2.49 a gallon for whatever a full tank would cost no matter how much gas you leave in the car. If you can fill up the car right before turning it in, you will save some $$. Simply tell them, I will fill it up before returning it. This experience would get a 1 rating!\\r\\n\\r\\nProblem- car is leaking exhaust inside:\\r\\nSome times you really find out about a company when you have a problem. I read some past reviews and was dreading this. I called and while it took about 30 minutes, when I spoke to someone she was friendly, professional and helped me get another car. We did go from a Ford Fusion Hybrid to a caravan but we didn't have headaches or feel nauseous in the caravan so all was good and they were quick. (Note: as we were leaving we saw them washing the car that has an exhaust leak so one can only assume it was going to be rented again and not fixed. This experience would get a 4 rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning the van:\\r\\nEverything when smooth and quick. This would get a 5 rating.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall: my rating is a 3 because of the bad attitude and sales techniques at check out and a car that wasn't up to standards. I would give them another chance.\n",

Staff seems to have difficulty keeping you updated on what is going on with maintenance issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery place has issues I understand but this frequently is a bit rediculous                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "263667 I've been to Snug on numerous occasions, and I do enjoy my time when I go! However, I believe that the menu does need an update. For the prices they are serving, and the beautiful location, the food is not on par. The crab cakes are amazing, and I've had my fair share of fish, steak, ahi tuna, good but not amazing. \\r\\n\\r\\nCome for a good meal and beautiful location, but after being there many times, menu needs an update! I hope the chefs see this! Hope they are not cutting corners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "22427  I spent last night at the Sheraton Suites Calgary Eau Claire ($317/night plus taxes).\\r\\n\\r\\nMy view was of Eau Claire Market across the street.  The bed was comfy,  There was a nice array of bath products.  There was a spa gift bag available for $29.50.  I've never seen a shower pouf in a hotel before.  The extra roll of toilet paper had a furry cover.  There was a microwave and mini fridge in the room ... the mini fridge was stocked with water, beer, hard liquor and wine (for a cost).  There were snacks in a basket for sale\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I took a cab from the airport, there is valet parking only and it's $29/day during the week and $40/day on the weekends.  There is a parking lot across the street but it seems to be pricey too.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two restaurants in the hotel plus a couple across the street.  It's downtown so walkable to most businesses (which is what I did).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "300708 It was very quiet and peaceful. I picked this place because of the reviews and when I called he was friendly and patient with me. Attentive staff that wasn't helping the other patrons. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe gentleman that did my Ultimate Deluxe Pedicure was quiet, but I appreciated that. The filing was too aggressive at first but once I spoke up he was great! I always find a complaint about the massage being too soft and not looking enough, and here it was great! First pedicure in a year and only 2nd time ever feeling satisfied in my massage!\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll definitely be back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "567961 Pretty awful. Salad bar offerings didn't look fresh, food oversalted but wholly lacking in flavor. Inordinately long wait for everything. Server NEVER offered refills on drinks. Place isn't particularly clean, either. I waited till I got home because the ladies' room was so nasty. This place was good years ago, I'm told, but it's surely not now. I question the safety of eating here based on all I saw. This included seeing an employee run hands through her hair and go right back to food prep....yuck!!!! But enough, I'll never eat there again.

       "595871 I love Whole Foods. I wish I could afford to actually shop here, rather than pop in for a few obscure things every now and then. Some how I tend to gravitate toward the general merchandise (lotions, essential oils, etc.) than I do the actual foods. Food wise, you're obviously going to get a better price elsewhere, but the general stuff is pretty on par price wise, at least from what I've seen. Back at Christmas time, I was looking for some food-grade vegetable glycerin to make vanilla extract with and it was the same price here as it was online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "434896 We eat here at least once a month. The service is consistently excellent. Atmosphere is casual and comfortable. \\r\\nThe food isn't outstanding but it is okay. The fries are my least favorite and the item I have complained most about so now I just avoid them. They taste old. Like they have been under a warmer for hours, limp and  tasteless. Warm, not hot. The onion rings have no salt or flavor.\\r\\nThe salads are a very generous portion and fresh.\\r\\n I really like the black bean burgers and southwest egg rolls.Margaritas are good.\\r\\n I do recommend this place for a nice meal without being fancy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
